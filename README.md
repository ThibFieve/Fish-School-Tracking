# Stochastic Processes: Simulation and Tracking of a fish school through statistical processes

*Stochastic Processes: Tracking of a fish school*,
Sep 2018 – Jan 2019

__Tasks:__ In the context of the Stochastic Process course. We implement a simulation of tracking a fish school when confronted to a predator.

## Problem solving strategy:

__Part1:__ Fishes motion statistical characterisation

* Setting the problem: N empirical observation, speed as random variable, known parametric data model
* Mathematical development for the Maximum likelyhood estimator and the method of moment
* Python simulations for deciding the best estimator compared to data.

__Part2:__ Fish tracking through time

* Reformulation of the problem as a stochastic process
* Implementation of a Monte Carlo filter
* Matlab simulations.

*Fig.3 - On the left figure , the evolution of the MLE when the number of particle increases for a determined
σ²obs=0.5 and a time step=0.05s. On the right one, evolution of the MLE when the time step increases with the
same σ²obs=0.5 and for 500 particles.*
